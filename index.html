            <h1>About Justine</h1>
            <p>Justine McGrath is a Southern California-based writer with an interest in travel and proper grammar. In 2012,
                she graduated from the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) with a B.A. in Communications. Following
                graduation, she worked at the La Jolla Playhouse, learning about event production and marketing. After her
                time spent scurrying around dimly lit theaters and creating compelling marketing emails, she was hired at
                a local marketing agency, PACIFIC.
            </p>
            <p>She spent several years at PACIFIC — some of them as a copywriter, and others as the agency’s sole marketing
                employee. During her time at PACIFIC, she learned that anything is possible with a touch of talent, a dose
                of self-confidence, and lots of hard work. She also discovered the world of travel blogging. The agency represented
                numerous travel bloggers, a.k.a. people who were paid to travel the world.
            </p>
            <p>She realized that if other people could leave behind their desk jobs in the pursuit of adventure, she could
                too. So, in 2016 she hit the road and spent nearly a year traveling through nine Asian countries. She’s been
                freelancing since she said “Au revoir” to America in 2016, even though she’s since returned to her roots
                in San Diego.
            </p>
            <p>She now happily reside in Crown Point, one of San Diego’s many quirky beachfront neighborhoods, and writes
                for a range of clients including Teen Vogue, Expedia, Locale Magazine, and more.</p>
            <p>For those looking to collaborate, Justine can be reached at justinejmcgrath@gmail.com.</p>

            <h1>My Writing</h1>
            <p>My interest in writing dates back to childhood, but I’ve worked as a professional storyteller since 2013.
                I’ve done everything from producing copy for motivational speakers to writing entertainment articles for
                Teen Vogue. In addition to creating powerful on-page copy and blogs, I have extensive experience in creating
                marketing materials for brands, such as white papers, press releases, style guides, and more. Curious to
                check out my work? Please view the links and brands below for some examples.</p>
