        <h2>About Justine</h2>
        <p>Justine McGrath is a Southern California-based writer with an interest in travel and proper grammar. In 2012,
            she graduated from the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) with a B.A. in Communications. Following graduation,
            she worked at the La Jolla Playhouse, learning about event production and marketing. After her time spent scurrying
            around dimly lit theaters and creating compelling marketing emails, she was hired at a local marketing agency,
            PACIFIC.
